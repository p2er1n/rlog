* simulator
Chinese: *仿真器*

In CS, it refers to the software which behaves like another hardware or device especially for studying and researching it.

For example, if there is a software displaying 3d model of real world, we can call it a simulator.
* emulator

In CS, it refers to the software which behaves like another hardware or device but especially for using it.

For example, QEMU is a emulator.
